#' biostan: Companion package to BioC 2016 Workshop entitled "Introduction to Bayesian Inference using Stan with Applications to Cancer Genomics"
#'
#' This workshop will provide a background and introduction to Bayesian analysis using Stan and R interfaces to Stan. We will then work through 1-2 example applications in the area of cancer genomics.
#'
#' [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) is a modern probabilistic programming language implementing full Bayesian
#'  statistical inference with MCMC sampling (NUTS, HMC), approximate Bayesian inference with
#'  variational inference (ADVI), and penalized maximum likelihood estimation with optimization (L-BFGS).
#'
#' This package contains vignettes & utility functions in support of the BioC 2016 workshop.
